# Why is this here and why are the solutions so bad?

Looking at the current coding meta I saw a clear problem, too much good and readable code. I think this is way too unrealistic considering the product-driven programming industry. So, I present to you my strictly unrefactored, algorithmically inefficient, sleep-deprived and purely script-kiddie "just works" code that I'm surprised didn't raise a runtime error.
